# CMMS Business Process Flow Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) business process flows based on the main process flow diagram. The CMMS system integrates multiple interconnected modules to provide end-to-end maintenance management capabilities.

## Main Process Flow Description

The main CMMS process flow diagram illustrates the interconnected nature of five core modules:

1. **Inventory Management** (Blue sections) - Handles procurement, stock management, and parts distribution
2. **Asset Management** (Green sections) - Manages asset lifecycle, performance monitoring, and resource allocation
3. **Work Order Management** (Purple sections) - Controls work order creation, execution, and completion
4. **Preventive & Corrective Maintenance** (Orange/Red sections) - Manages scheduled and reactive maintenance activities
5. **Human Resource Management** (Light Green sections) - Coordinates personnel and equipment resources

The flow demonstrates how data and processes flow between modules, with the central CMMS database serving as the integration hub for reporting, analytics, and data management. Each module feeds into and receives data from others, creating a comprehensive maintenance ecosystem.
